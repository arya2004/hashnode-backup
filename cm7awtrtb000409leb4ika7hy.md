In this blog, we will explore the **detailed path** of a request from the moment it leaves the client (front-end or another service) until it **enters** your backend application’s user space. We often focus on the final arrival of an HTTP request handler (like an `http.HandlerFunc` in Go or the “on request” event in Node.js), but beneath that, there is a wealth of complexity.

**Why should you care about these hidden steps?** Because understanding them lets you troubleshoot performance issues, handle security concerns better, and scale more wisely. Too many engineers simply add more servers when facing bottlenecks—sometimes prematurely—without pinpointing the real cause (like slow acceptance, TLS overhead, partial reading, or inefficient parsing).

Below, we detail each step:

1. **Accept** – How the operating system kernel and your code handle the new connection, from `SYN` packets to accept queues.
    
2. **Read** – How raw bytes flow from the kernel’s receive queue into your application.
    
3. **Decrypt** – Unveiling TLS overhead and CPU usage.
    
4. **Parse** – Extracting structure from raw streams (e.g., HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, or custom protocols).
    
5. **Decode** – Translating the parsed data (e.g., JSON, form data, or UTF-8 strings).
    
6. **Process** – Where your **real** backend logic finally kicks in.
    

By the time your app sees a “request object,” countless steps have quietly happened under the hood. Let’s take a deep dive.

## A Quick Note on What “Request” Really Means

In networking terms, a **“request”** is a **unit of work** or an **operation** that a client or frontend (which could be a web browser, a mobile app, or another microservice) sends to your server. This request is typically governed by a **protocol** that defines how to start and end a request, what headers or metadata exist, and how the body is structured.

The most common protocol is **HTTP** (in flavors like HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3 via QUIC, etc.). But you can define your own. For instance:

* A custom binary protocol with fixed-size requests.
    
* A streaming protocol with special delimiters.
    
* JSON-based protocols layered on top of websockets.
    

**All these differences** matter because they influence **how** you parse, decode, and handle data. Even if you never write your own protocol, understanding how existing ones (like HTTP) work helps you troubleshoot real-world issues.

# Step 1: Accept

### 1.1 The Kernel’s Role in Accepting Connections

Before your backend process “knows” about a connection, the OS kernel does several things:

1. You **listen** on a port (e.g., 8080). Internally, Linux (or another OS) creates a **socket** (which is effectively a file descriptor) associated with that port.
    
2. The kernel allocates two special queues for that listening socket:
    
    * **SYN Queue**: Holds half-open connections in the midst of the TCP three-way handshake (after receiving a `SYN` but before finalizing `SYN/ACK` → `ACK`).
        
    * **Accept Queue**: Holds fully established connections (those that have passed the entire handshake).
        

When a client sends a `SYN` packet to your server, the kernel places it in the **SYN Queue**, replies with `SYN/ACK`, and waits for the client’s `ACK`. If the client acknowledges, that connection moves to the **Accept Queue**.

### 1.2 Accepting in the Application

In **Go**, the code to listen and accept connections looks deceptively simple:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net"
)

func main() {
    // Listen on TCP port 8080
    ln, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":8080")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    fmt.Println("Server is listening on port 8080...")

    for {
        // Accept a new connection from the Accept Queue
        conn, err := ln.Accept()
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println("Error accepting connection:", err)
            continue
        }
        fmt.Println("New connection accepted!")
        go handleConnection(conn)
    }
}

func handleConnection(conn net.Conn) {
    // We will handle reading, decrypting, etc., in later steps
    defer conn.Close()
    // For now, let's just hold the connection open briefly
    fmt.Println("Handle connection here. The actual read steps come next.")
}
```

Notice:

* `net.Listen("tcp", ":8080")`: Opens the socket and sets up the accept queues.
    
* `ln.Accept()`: Pulls a connection from the Accept Queue. If the Accept Queue is empty, `Accept()` blocks until new connections arrive.
    

### 1.3 Tuning the Backlog

When you call `ln, _ := net.Listen("tcp", ":8080")`, you can (in lower-level APIs) specify a “backlog” parameter. This controls how many connections can accumulate in the Accept Queue. If the backlog is exceeded, new `SYN`s might be dropped or delayed. On some systems, you can tune it via:

```bash
sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=1024
```

(A typical default might be 128 or 256, which can be too small if you experience heavy bursts.)

### 1.4 Multiple Acceptors and Scaling

You can accept connections in **multiple goroutines or even multiple processes**. In Linux, you might do:

* Set `SO_REUSEPORT` to allow multiple processes to listen on the same port, distributing load.
    
* In Go, you might have multiple goroutines calling `Accept()` in parallel, although Go’s standard library by default uses a single `Accept()` loop.
    

This addresses scenarios with extremely high connection rates, but it also complicates concurrency.

# Step 2: Read

### 2.1 TCP Streams and Kernel Buffers

Once a connection is established, the client can start sending data. This data arrives at your server’s **network interface** and is moved into the kernel’s **receive queue** for that specific connection.

* Each connection has its own “receive queue” where packets (TCP segments) are buffered.
    
* The OS acknowledges each segment (TCP handles acknowledgment, retransmission, window sizes, etc. at the kernel level).
    

### 2.2 Copy to User Space

Your Go code eventually calls something like:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    ln, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":8080")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error setting up listener:", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }

    fmt.Println("Listening on :8080...")

    for {
        conn, err := ln.Accept()
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println("Accept error:", err)
            continue
        }
        go handleConnection(conn)
    }
}

func handleConnection(conn net.Conn) {
    defer conn.Close()

    // Read up to 1024 bytes
    buffer := make([]byte, 1024)
    n, err := conn.Read(buffer)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error reading from connection:", err)
        return
    }
    fmt.Printf("Read %d bytes: %v\n", n, buffer[:n])

    // In real scenarios, we'd do more logic here
    // ...
}
```

When [`conn.Read`](http://conn.Read)`(buffer)` executes, it **copies** data from the **kernel** receive buffer into your **user-space** buffer (`buffer`). This is a **blocking** call unless there’s data available.

### 2.3 Partial Reads and Protocol Considerations

TCP is a **stream** protocol, not message-based. This means:

* You might read 50% of one request, or 1.5 requests if the client pipelined them, or no data at all if it hasn’t arrived yet.
    
* Your code typically loops until you confirm you have a **complete** request.
    

In many frameworks, you do not see this loop because the library handles it. However, under the hood, it’s doing exactly that.

### 2.4 Performance Implications

If your code is slow to read data, the kernel’s receive buffer may fill up. This can lead to **TCP backpressure** (window size reduction, potential retransmissions). In high-load systems, reading quickly and properly is crucial to maintain throughput.

**Also** consider your concurrency model:

* If you have thousands of connections, each might be in a separate goroutine or thread waiting to read.
    
* If you have insufficient concurrency, new connections might starve waiting for CPU cycles.
    

# Step 3: Decrypt (Optional, but Common with HTTPS)

### 3.1 TLS Handshake Basics

If you are running **HTTPS** or any TLS-encrypted protocol, the handshake (key exchange) has already taken place after the **Accept** step but before actual data is read as **plaintext**. This handshake involves:

1. Client and server agreeing on TLS version, ciphers.
    
2. Exchanging keys securely (asymmetric cryptography).
    
3. Establishing a **symmetric key** for ongoing encryption.
    

### 3.2 CPU Overhead of Decryption

Each packet is encrypted by the client and must be **decrypted** by your server. This typically uses algorithms like AES (in GCM mode, CBC, or others). Decryption is **CPU-expensive** compared to plain TCP. Under heavy loads (thousands of concurrent HTTPS connections), CPU usage can spike just from encryption/decryption tasks.

### 3.3 Go Example with TLS

In Go, you might do something like:

```go
package main

import (
    "crypto/tls"
    "fmt"
    "net"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    cert, err := tls.LoadX509KeyPair("server.crt", "server.key")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error loading TLS certificate:", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }

    tlsConfig := &tls.Config{Certificates: []tls.Certificate{cert}}

    // Listen on TLS port 8443
    ln, err := tls.Listen("tcp", ":8443", tlsConfig)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error listening on TLS port:", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    fmt.Println("TLS server listening on port 8443...")

    for {
        conn, err := ln.Accept()
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println("Error accepting TLS connection:", err)
            continue
        }
        go handleTLSConnection(conn)
    }
}

func handleTLSConnection(conn net.Conn) {
    defer conn.Close()

    // Under the hood, conn.Read() is now reading encrypted data
    // from the kernel and decrypting it into plaintext
    buffer := make([]byte, 2048)
    n, err := conn.Read(buffer)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error reading from TLS connection:", err)
        return
    }

    fmt.Printf("Decrypted %d bytes: %s\n", n, string(buffer[:n]))
    // We can proceed with parse/decode steps on the plaintext data
}
```

Notice that we don’t manually handle encryption or decryption. The **Go TLS** library does it automatically. But the CPU overhead is still **your** server’s responsibility.

### 3.4 Memory Copies and Modern Solutions

Data is typically copied multiple times (kernel memory → user space encrypted buffer → user space decrypted buffer). Innovations like **io\_uring** aim to reduce these copies in Linux, but they’re still in relatively early adoption.

# Step 4: Parse

### 4.1 Parsing Protocol Structures

Now that you (potentially) have **plaintext** data in user space, the next step is to figure out **how** to interpret it. For HTTP/1.1:

1. You look for the **request line**, e.g. `GET / HTTP/1.1`.
    
2. Then, you parse headers (one per line) until you reach a blank line.
    
3. If there’s a **Content-Length** header, you know how many bytes of body to read. If it’s chunked encoding, you parse chunk by chunk.
    

With HTTP/2, parsing is more involved because data is framed. You must read frame headers, handle stream identifiers, window updates, etc.

**Every** protocol has to define how to separate “packets” or “requests” from the raw byte stream. This is called **message framing**.

### 4.2 Example: Naive Parsing in Go

Here’s a complete example that **very naively** parses a single HTTP/1.1 request. It reads once, looks for the request line and headers, and prints them. (In a real server, you must handle partial reads, chunked bodies, etc.)

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net"
    "os"
    "strings"
)

func main() {
    ln, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":8080")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error setting up listener:", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }

    fmt.Println("Naive HTTP Parser listening on :8080")

    for {
        conn, err := ln.Accept()
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println("Error accepting connection:", err)
            continue
        }
        go parseHTTPConnection(conn)
    }
}

// parseHTTPConnection attempts to parse an HTTP/1.1 request from a single read
func parseHTTPConnection(conn net.Conn) {
    defer conn.Close()

    buffer := make([]byte, 4096)
    n, err := conn.Read(buffer)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error reading:", err)
        return
    }

    requestData := string(buffer[:n])
    fmt.Println("Raw HTTP data received:")
    fmt.Println(requestData)

    // Split into lines
    lines := strings.Split(requestData, "\r\n")
    if len(lines) < 1 {
        fmt.Println("No valid HTTP line found")
        return
    }

    // First line is usually "METHOD PATH HTTP/1.1"
    requestLine := lines[0]
    fmt.Println("Request Line:", requestLine)

    // Print headers
    i := 1
    for ; i < len(lines); i++ {
        if lines[i] == "" {
            // empty line -> end of headers
            break
        }
        fmt.Println("Header:", lines[i])
    }

    // i now points to the blank line after headers
    // If there's more data, it might be the body.
    if i < len(lines)-1 {
        body := strings.Join(lines[i+1:], "\r\n")
        fmt.Println("Body:", body)
    }

    // Send a very simple response
    response := "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/plain\r\n\r\nHello from naive parser!\r\n"
    conn.Write([]byte(response))
}
```

* **Step 1 & 2** (Accept, Read) are integrated.
    
* We skip Step 3 (Decrypt) because it’s plain TCP.
    
* **Step 4**: We parse the HTTP request line and headers.
    

This is oversimplified but shows how you might approach protocol parsing. In production, you rely on robust libraries (`net/http`, `nghttp2`, etc.).

### 4.3 CPU Costs of Parsing

Parsing can be CPU-intensive if you have:

* Very large headers.
    
* Complex structured data (like HTTP/2 frames).
    
* Many simultaneous connections.
    

**HTTP/2** is more expensive than **HTTP/1.1** because it uses compression for headers (HPACK or QPACK in HTTP/3) and frames. This is beneficial for multiplexing but costs more CPU to handle.

# Step 5: Decode

### 5.1 Beyond Parsing: Decoding the Body

Once the protocol is **parsed**, you likely have a **body** in raw text or binary. Now you must **decode** or **deserialize** it into something meaningful for your application.

* **JSON** or XML: Convert from raw text to structured data (maps, structs, etc.).
    
* **Binary** protocols (like Protobuf, MessagePack): Convert from binary frames to objects.
    
* **Form data**: Parse `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data`.
    

This can be an expensive operation if the body is large or if you do repeated decoding.

### 5.2 JSON Example

Below is a complete sample that reads a raw HTTP-like request, extracts a JSON body, and decodes it into a Go struct:

```go
package main

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "fmt"
    "net"
    "os"
    "strings"
)

type Payload struct {
    Name  string `json:"name"`
    Email string `json:"email"`
}

func main() {
    ln, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":8080")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error setting up listener:", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    fmt.Println("Listening on :8080 for JSON decode example...")

    for {
        conn, err := ln.Accept()
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println("Error accepting connection:", err)
            continue
        }
        go handleJSONConn(conn)
    }
}

func handleJSONConn(conn net.Conn) {
    defer conn.Close()

    buf := make([]byte, 4096)
    n, err := conn.Read(buf)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error reading:", err)
        return
    }

    // Very naive parse again
    requestData := string(buf[:n])
    lines := strings.Split(requestData, "\r\n")

    // Find blank line to separate headers from body
    bodyIndex := -1
    for i, line := range lines {
        if line == "" {
            bodyIndex = i + 1
            break
        }
    }

    if bodyIndex == -1 || bodyIndex >= len(lines) {
        fmt.Println("No body found in request")
        return
    }

    body := strings.Join(lines[bodyIndex:], "\r\n")

    // Step 5: Decode JSON
    var payload Payload
    err = json.Unmarshal([]byte(body), &payload)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("JSON decoding error:", err)
        return
    }

    fmt.Printf("Decoded JSON: Name=%s, Email=%s\n", payload.Name, payload.Email)

    // Respond
    response := "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/plain\r\n\r\nReceived JSON. Thank you!\r\n"
    conn.Write([]byte(response))
}
```

1. **Parsing**: We look for headers, find the blank line, treat the rest as the body.
    
2. **Decoding**: We use `json.Unmarshal` to parse into a `Payload` struct.
    

### 5.3 Watch Out for Large JSON

* Large or nested JSON objects can balloon CPU usage.
    
* If you do repeated decoding in hot loops, it can slow your server drastically.
    

Also be mindful of memory usage. Some languages and frameworks use streaming parsers to avoid loading the entire body in memory at once.

# Step 6: Process

Finally, after all the above steps, you have identified a **complete request** and turned it into **application-friendly data** (like a struct, an object, or key-value pairs). Now you can do the real logic:

1. **Business Rules**: E.g., “Retrieve top 10 books,” “create a user,” “apply a discount.”
    
2. **Database Access**: The backend becomes a “client” to the database server, ironically repeating many of these steps (SYN, Accept, parse, decode) at the DB side.
    
3. **Send a Response**: The response might also get encoded (e.g., JSON), parsed into frames (e.g., HTTP/2 frames), then **encrypted** if using TLS, and finally written to the kernel send queue, traveling back to the client.
    

### 6.1 CPU-Bound vs. IO-Bound

Your processing might be:

* **CPU-Bound**: e.g., cryptographic tasks, image processing, big data computations in memory.
    
* **IO-Bound**: e.g., calling out to external services, databases, or reading large files from disk.
    

Understanding whether your requests are CPU- or IO-bound shapes how you scale (number of worker goroutines, concurrency patterns, etc.).

### 6.2 Handling Multiple Requests

Modern servers often handle many concurrent requests. In **Go**, concurrency via goroutines is relatively light. However, each request flow includes:

1. Accepting a connection.
    
2. Possibly reading partial data many times.
    
3. Decrypting if TLS.
    
4. Parsing and decoding.
    
5. Processing.
    

If you reach thousands of concurrent requests, you might saturate:

* **CPU**: If cryptography or parsing is heavy.
    
* **Memory**: If requests are large.
    
* **Network**: If your throughput is enormous.
    

Optimizing each step is essential before deciding to spin up more machines.

## Why Understanding These Steps Matters

1. **Performance Tuning**:
    
    * If your bottleneck is *accepting connections*, tune backlog or parallel acceptance.
        
    * If your bottleneck is in *TLS decryption*, consider optimizing ciphers, using hardware acceleration, or carefully analyzing concurrency.
        
    * If your bottleneck is *parsing* or *decoding*, analyze your library or consider partial/parsing streaming.
        
2. **Security**:
    
    * Know how and where your **private keys** are used (in memory, in a secure TPM, etc.).
        
    * Understand that *any* buffer containing sensitive data (after decryption) might leak if there is a bug (e.g., Heartbleed-type vulnerabilities).
        
3. **Troubleshooting**:
    
    * Dropped connections? Possibly backlog overflow or ephemeral ports are exhausted.
        
    * Slow responses? Possibly waiting for partial data or stuck in a CPU-heavy decode.
        
    * High CPU usage? Possibly from TLS overhead or large JSON parsing.
        
4. **Scalability**:
    
    * Sometimes you do not need 10 extra servers if you find that your “Decode” step is the real problem (maybe it’s slow or done repeatedly).
        
    * Understanding each stage fosters more informed decisions about load balancing, caching, concurrency, or even rewriting certain parts in a more efficient manner.
        

# Example: A “Full” (Yet Simplistic) Go Server Demonstrating All Steps

Below is a **single** program that tries to incorporate all six steps in one place. In real production, you would likely use `net/http` or another fully-featured library, but let’s do it manually to illustrate the entire journey:

```go
package main

import (
    "crypto/tls"
    "encoding/json"
    "fmt"
    "io"
    "net"
    "os"
    "strings"
)

// Let's define a sample JSON payload structure
type SampleRequest struct {
    Action string `json:"action"`
    Data   string `json:"data"`
}

// main function sets up a TLS listener to show the whole journey
func main() {
    // Load TLS certificate and key (assumes server.crt and server.key are present)
    cert, err := tls.LoadX509KeyPair("server.crt", "server.key")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error loading certificates:", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    tlsConfig := &tls.Config{
        Certificates: []tls.Certificate{cert},
    }

    // Step 1: Accept
    // Listen on TLS port 8443
    ln, err := tls.Listen("tcp", ":8443", tlsConfig)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error listening on port 8443:", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    fmt.Println("TLS Server listening on port 8443...")

    for {
        conn, err := ln.Accept()
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println("Error accepting connection:", err)
            continue
        }
        // Handle each connection in a separate goroutine
        go handleTLSConn(conn)
    }
}

func handleTLSConn(conn net.Conn) {
    defer conn.Close()

    // Step 2: Read (the data is initially encrypted, but net.Conn is now a TLS conn)
    // Under the hood, Step 3 (Decrypt) is happening automatically, so by the time
    // we read from conn, we get plaintext.
    buffer := make([]byte, 4096)
    n, err := conn.Read(buffer)
    if err != nil && err != io.EOF {
        fmt.Println("Read error:", err)
        return
    }

    // We might get partial data or entire request; let's assume it's enough for illustration
    plaintext := string(buffer[:n])
    fmt.Println("Received (decrypted) data:", plaintext)

    // Step 4: Parse naive HTTP
    lines := strings.Split(plaintext, "\r\n")
    if len(lines) < 1 {
        fmt.Println("No valid HTTP request line found.")
        return
    }
    // The first line should be something like: "POST / HTTP/1.1"
    fmt.Println("Request line:", lines[0])

    // Find blank line to separate headers from body
    blankLineIndex := -1
    for i, line := range lines {
        if line == "" {
            blankLineIndex = i
            break
        }
    }
    if blankLineIndex == -1 {
        fmt.Println("Could not find blank line for body separation.")
        return
    }

    // Step 5: Decode JSON from the body
    bodySlice := lines[blankLineIndex+1:]
    body := strings.Join(bodySlice, "\r\n")
    var req SampleRequest
    err = json.Unmarshal([]byte(body), &req)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("JSON Unmarshal error:", err)
        return
    }
    fmt.Printf("Decoded JSON: Action=%s, Data=%s\n", req.Action, req.Data)

    // Step 6: Process - let's do something trivial, like just print
    responseMsg := fmt.Sprintf("Action: %s, Data: %s - Processed!\n", req.Action, req.Data)
    fmt.Println("Processing complete. Sending response...")

    // Form a basic HTTP 200 response
    response := "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/plain\r\n\r\n" + responseMsg

    // We write the response back, which will be encrypted again by TLS

    }
}
```

**Explanations**:

1. **Accept**: `tls.Listen("tcp", ":8443", tlsConfig)` sets up a TLS listener, and `Accept()` pulls connections off the Accept Queue.
    
2. **Read**: We call [`conn.Read`](http://conn.Read)`(buffer)` to copy from kernel buffer → user space.
    
3. **Decrypt**: Under the hood, the TLS library is decrypting for us. We see plaintext in `plaintext`.
    
4. **Parse**: We do a naive parse of the first line (method, path, version) and find where headers end (`\r\n\r\n`).
    
5. **Decode**: We take the body portion and unmarshal JSON into `SampleRequest`.
    
6. **Process**: Here, we just print out the request data. In real scenarios, you’d do DB queries, business logic, etc., then we form an HTTP response and send it back.
    

Notice how many steps are hidden by libraries. If you used the standard `net/http` library, you would see just `http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request){...})`, but behind the scenes, the library is doing everything we described.

# Final Thoughts

There is a **vast** amount of hidden complexity **before** your backend sees a “request.” Each of the six steps—Accept, Read, Decrypt, Parse, Decode, and Process—can itself be a **bottleneck** or a **source of errors**.

### Key Points to Remember

* **Accept**: The kernel must handle the TCP three-way handshake, manage the Accept Queue, and eventually give your application a new socket/file descriptor. If your accept loop is slow, or the backlog is too small, you drop connections.
    
* **Read**: Data is stored in the kernel’s receive queue, and you must copy it into user space. Partial data is normal in TCP, so robust code typically loops until it has what it needs.
    
* **Decrypt**: With HTTPS, decryption can heavily load the CPU. Tools like hardware acceleration or efficient ciphers can help.
    
* **Parse**: Understanding the protocol (HTTP/1.1 vs. HTTP/2 vs. custom) is crucial. HTTP/2 frames, for instance, are more complex than HTTP/1.1 lines. Parsing overhead can be non-trivial.
    
* **Decode**: Once you have the protocol-level structure, you still need to transform it (JSON, XML, Form data) into an in-memory format. This step can be memory- and CPU-intensive for large bodies.
    
* **Process**: Finally, your application logic (database queries, CPU tasks, etc.) occurs. This is often the step we focus on, but by then, a lot has already happened.
    

By shining light on these stages, you can identify where your bottlenecks truly lie. Rather than always scaling horizontally with more machines, you might discover that you can optimize your acceptance strategy, tune your TLS settings, or handle decoding more efficiently.

## Additional Tips and Insights

1. **TLS Offloading**: In some architectures, you offload TLS to a load balancer (like an Nginx or HAProxy). This spares your backend from CPU encryption/decryption. But it’s still happening somewhere, and you still have to consider overhead.
    
2. **Node.js vs Go**: Node’s single-threaded event loop means one thread calls `accept` and handles read events asynchronously. Go’s concurrency model uses goroutines (multiplexed on threads). The underlying concepts, however, remain the same (SYN queue, Accept queue, kernel buffers).
    
3. **Large Payloads**: If you expect large JSON or file uploads, consider streaming. Instead of reading everything into memory, you can process chunks as they arrive. This approach lowers memory usage and can reduce latency for large payloads.
    
4. **HTTP/2** Gains & Costs\*\*: HTTP/2 multiplexing can reduce the number of TCP connections, but the protocol overhead and header compression can increase CPU usage. Evaluate these trade-offs based on your traffic patterns.
    
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Tools like `strace`, `tcpdump`, or application-level profiling (`pprof` in Go) can help pinpoint if you’re CPU-bound (in JSON parsing or TLS) or if you’re stuck in slow I/O.
    

## Conclusion

We’ve seen how **every request** travels through multiple stages before your code calls it a “request.” By recognizing the **Accept → Read → Decrypt → Parse → Decode → Process** flow, you get greater visibility into **why** performance, security, or scaling problems may arise.

* Some steps (like **Accept** and **Read**) are heavily dependent on the operating system’s kernel and network stack.
    
* Others (like **Decrypt** and **Parse**) rely on CPU and library efficiency.
    
* The final user-land steps (like **Decode** and **Process**) reflect how you interpret data and apply your business logic.
    

When trouble hits, or you need to scale, you now have the mental framework to say, “Okay, which step is the real culprit?” Sometimes, small adjustments—like increasing the Accept backlog, switching to more efficient JSON decoding, or caching TLS sessions—can yield huge gains.
