PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its advanced features, extensibility, and standards compliance. A critical aspect of PostgreSQL's robustness lies in its architecture. This blog will delve into the internal architecture of PostgreSQL, exploring the various processes and components that ensure its efficient operation.

## Overview of PostgreSQL Architecture

PostgreSQL architecture comprises several processes and components working in tandem to handle connections, manage memory, perform I/O operations, and maintain the database system's overall integrity. Let's break down these elements to understand their roles and interactions.

[![Postgres Architecture](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1720637886961/c920391d-a762-4df5-be06-1467be85d9b9.jpeg align="center")](https://medium.com/@hnasr/postgresql-process-architecture-f21e16459907)

### Postmaster Process

The heart of PostgreSQL is the Postmaster process. This is the initial process that starts when the PostgreSQL server is launched. The Postmaster listens for connection requests from clients on a specified port (default is 5432) and manages the creation of new backend processes for each client connection. It acts as a parent to all other processes, ensuring that the database remains responsive and operational.

### Backend Processes

Each client connection is handled by a separate backend process, which is forked by the Postmaster. This process-per-connection model, though resource-intensive, ensures isolation and stability. Backend processes execute SQL queries, manage transactions, and handle client communication. The number of backend processes is limited by the `max_connections` configuration parameter to prevent resource exhaustion.

### Shared Memory and Buffers

PostgreSQL uses shared memory to facilitate communication and data sharing between processes. The shared memory includes several critical components:

1. **Shared Buffers**: These are used to cache data pages read from the disk, reducing I/O operations and speeding up query performance.
    
2. **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)**: WAL records all changes to the database to ensure durability and crash recovery. The WAL buffer holds these changes temporarily before they are flushed to disk.
    

### Background Workers

Introduced in PostgreSQL 9.6, background workers enhance parallel processing capabilities. These workers handle tasks such as parallel query execution and maintenance operations, helping distribute the load and improve performance. Background workers are managed by the `max_worker_processes` configuration parameter.

### Auxiliary Processes

Several auxiliary processes support PostgreSQL's operations, each with specific responsibilities:

1. **Background Writer**: Periodically flushes dirty pages from shared buffers to the operating system's file system cache, helping manage the buffer pool efficiently.
    
2. **Checkpointer**: Ensures data durability by writing all modified data pages and WAL records to disk at regular intervals, creating a consistent database state known as a checkpoint.

3. **Logger**: Handles logging of database activities and errors to disk, aiding in monitoring and troubleshooting.
    
4. **Auto Vacuum Launcher and Workers**: Maintain database health by cleaning up dead tuples left behind by updates and deletes, reclaiming storage space, and preventing table bloat.
    
5. **WAL Archiver and Receiver**: Manage WAL file archiving and replication, crucial for backup and high availability setups.
    

## Process Communication and Memory Management

Processes in PostgreSQL communicate and share data through shared memory segments, synchronized using various synchronization primitives like mutexes and semaphores to prevent race conditions. The efficient management of shared memory and inter-process communication is vital for PostgreSQL's performance and reliability.

### The Forking Mechanism

PostgreSQL's choice of using processes over threads is rooted in historical stability concerns. Each backend process is a result of the Postmaster forking itself. This forking mechanism involves creating a new process with its own memory space, initially shared with the parent process but later employing a copy-on-write strategy to handle modifications, ensuring efficiency and isolation.

### Crash Recovery and the Startup Process

In the event of a crash, PostgreSQL's startup process plays a crucial role in restoring the database to a consistent state. This process replays the WAL records from the last checkpoint, applying all changes to the data pages and ensuring that committed transactions are preserved, and incomplete transactions are rolled back.

## Postmaster Process: The Heartbeat of PostgreSQL

The Postmaster process is the cornerstone of PostgreSQL's operation. It is the initial process that starts when the PostgreSQL server is launched. The Postmaster listens for connection requests from clients on a specified port, which defaults to 5432. It is responsible for managing the creation of new backend processes for each client connection. Essentially, it acts as the parent process for all other processes in the system. This centralized control ensures that the database remains responsive, stable, and operational.

When a client attempts to connect to the PostgreSQL database, the Postmaster process forks a new backend process to handle the connection. This approach, although resource-intensive, guarantees isolation and stability for each client session. Each backend process is responsible for executing SQL queries, managing transactions, and communicating with the client. The number of backend processes is controlled by the `max_connections` configuration parameter, preventing the system from becoming overwhelmed by too many connections.

## Shared Memory: The Central Hub

PostgreSQL uses shared memory to facilitate communication and data sharing between its various processes. Shared memory includes several crucial components that are essential for efficient database operation:

1. **Shared Buffers**: These buffers are used to cache data pages read from the disk, which helps reduce the number of I/O operations and speeds up query performance. The more data that can be kept in shared buffers, the faster the database can respond to queries.
    
2. **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)**: WAL is a critical component of PostgreSQL's durability and crash recovery mechanisms. It records all changes made to the database, ensuring that no data is lost in the event of a crash. The WAL buffer temporarily holds these changes before they are flushed to disk.
    

## Background Workers: Enhancing Performance

Background workers are a relatively recent addition to PostgreSQL, introduced in version 9.6. These workers are designed to enhance the database's performance by handling tasks such as parallel query execution and routine maintenance operations. Background workers allow PostgreSQL to distribute the workload more evenly and efficiently, making better use of available resources. The `max_worker_processes` configuration parameter controls the number of background workers, ensuring that the system can scale effectively.

## Auxiliary Processes: Supporting the System

PostgreSQL relies on several auxiliary processes to support its core functions. Each of these processes has a specific role to play in maintaining the database system:

1. **Background Writer**: The background writer process is responsible for periodically flushing dirty pages from the shared buffers to the operating system's file system cache. This helps manage the buffer pool efficiently and ensures that there is always enough space available for new data.
    
2. **Checkpointer**: The checkpointer process is crucial for data durability. It writes all modified data pages and WAL records to disk at regular intervals, creating a consistent database state known as a checkpoint. This ensures that the database can recover to a known good state in the event of a crash.
    
3. **Logger**: The logger process handles the logging of database activities and errors to disk. This is essential for monitoring the database's health, diagnosing issues, and performing troubleshooting.
    
4. **Auto Vacuum Launcher and Workers**: The auto vacuum launcher and workers are responsible for maintaining the database's health by cleaning up dead tuples left behind by updates and deletes. This process helps reclaim storage space and prevents table bloat, which can degrade performance over time.

5. **WAL Archiver and Receiver**: These processes manage the archiving and replication of WAL files. This is crucial for backup and high availability setups, ensuring that the database can be restored to a consistent state in case of failure.
    

## Process Communication and Memory Management

Effective communication and memory management are essential for PostgreSQL's performance and reliability. Processes in PostgreSQL communicate and share data through shared memory segments. Synchronization primitives like mutexes and semaphores are used to prevent race conditions, ensuring that data integrity is maintained. The efficient management of shared memory and inter-process communication is vital for the database's smooth operation.

## The Forking Mechanism: Ensuring Isolation and Stability

PostgreSQL's architecture is based on processes rather than threads, a design choice rooted in historical concerns about stability. Each backend process is created by the Postmaster through a forking mechanism. This involves creating a new process with its own memory space, initially shared with the parent process. As the process begins to modify data, a copy-on-write strategy is employed to handle these changes efficiently, ensuring both isolation and performance.

## Crash Recovery and the Startup Process

In the event of a crash, PostgreSQL's startup process is responsible for restoring the database to a consistent state. This process replays the WAL records from the last checkpoint, applying all changes to the data pages. This ensures that committed transactions are preserved and incomplete transactions are rolled back, maintaining the integrity of the database.

The startup process is the first to run, even before the Postmaster process. It ensures that the database is in a consistent state before accepting new connections. By replaying the WAL records, the startup process brings the database to the state it was in before the crash, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

## Conclusion

PostgreSQL's architecture is a sophisticated interplay of various processes and components designed to ensure high performance, data integrity, and robustness. Understanding these internal mechanisms provides insight into why PostgreSQL is a preferred choice for many mission-critical applications.
